# UberEntitySystem
My version of an entity system. My goal is to make a system that does not need to have special build steps that make things complicated and take longer.

To see and overview of what my goals are with this project please see this video [![Project Overview](http://i.imgur.com/O5BCY6K.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJmVBo5HGOY&list=PL1fysVOvu6EBYJNVlV1xuCj5_cIP3ftML "UECS0 : What is an Entity Component System and Why should I care about ECS")

There is also a handy [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1fysVOvu6EBYJNVlV1xuCj5_cIP3ftML&disable_polymer=true "C# TDD Entity Component System Tutorial") of a tutorial series I am making on how to make this api from scratch!
